This project is a template for maps that display the usual map view in the centre of the page, but have a border made up of a row of pictures. Each picture will have a link to a place marker on the map.
   It could for example be a map of a city centre, with adverts linked to businesses; or it could be a map showing a holiday trip, with photos linked to the places they were taken. It should target print as
   the final output, so perhaps SVG, EPS, PDF, as long as there's an interim representation that can be edited and iterated on. Use typescript.
